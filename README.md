# Graphs_and_algorithms

### Implementing several graph related algorithms in a console application using C++

To run the program write 
> **make run**

### The console interface provides the following functionality:

1. Loading the original graph from a file
2. Graph traversal in breadth with output of the result to the console
3. Graph traversal in depth with output of the result to the console
4. Searching for the shortest path between any two vertices and displaying the result to the console
5. Searching for the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph with the output of the resulting matrix to the console
6. Searching for the minimal spanning tree in the graph with the output of the resulting adjacency matrix to the console
7. Solving the salesman problem with the output of the resulting route and its length to the console
8. Exporting graph to .dot file

### To run the tests (make sure gtest is installed) run
> **make test**
